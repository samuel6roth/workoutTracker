## Description
This application allows users to create or edit workouts.
## User Story
```
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
```
## Acceptance Criteria
```md
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.
